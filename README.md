# PS-Notebook

This PowerShell notebook is an interactive PowerShell console that allows you to write in markdown and execute PowerShell code in a notebook-like format. It is a great tool for learning PowerShell and for documenting your PowerShell scripts. It is similar to the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook for Python.

Most of the things covered here are from [Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches).
